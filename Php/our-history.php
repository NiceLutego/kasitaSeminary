        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p><?php echo $lang['The opening of Kasita Seminary in 1950 should never be considered the birth of the idea of establishing a seminary as a school to prepare young men who would become priests in the future. The idea of having local priests had been in the minds of missionaries since they began preaching the Gospel in the vicariate of Dar es Salaam.'];?></p>
        <p><?php echo $lang['The Capuchin missionaries arrived in Tanzania in 1921, taking over from the German Benedictines who left in 1917 after their defeat in the First World War against the British.'];?></p>
        <p>From the beginning, the missionaries saw the importance of having local priests, as it was the only way to root the church deeply in this country. In 1927, in Sali, they gathered a few young men and prepared them for seminary training. After one or two years, this group of young men joined the students of the Kwiro Central School. There, they were carefully evaluated to see if they were suitable for priestly training and were also taught Latin at that time.</p>
        <p>They emphasized that the priestly training given to local priests should never be of lower quality but should be equal to that offered to priests in Europe. As a result, they were able to obtain the first local priests: Father Elias Mchonde and Father Gregory Mpanda, who were ordained at the Church of Christ the King, Kwiro, on August 28, 1949.</p>
        <p>Father Elias Mchonde was born in the Mahenge district, and Father Gregory Mpanda was born in Kipatimu, in the Dar es Salaam diocese, which was then known as the 'Apostolic Vicariate of Dar es Salaam.' Mahenge was part of that diocese.</p>
        <p>Father Gerard felt special joy in having the first local priest from the Mahenge district, which was the result of his immense and immeasurable efforts. This is reflected in one of the poems he wrote during his lifetime:</p>
        <p>'At last, you stand here<br>At the altar after many years of hardship,<br>As a young priest, my African brother,<br>Who emerged from among the pagans.'</p>
        <p>These words truly brought great comfort to his heart, for after 20 years of trials, he was able to see his first student ordained as a priest. His dream had begun to come true. Thus, he hoped that the land of Kasita would remain even more fertile for preparing young men aspiring to become priests.</p>

        <h3>Construction of the Seminary and School Expansion</h3>
        <p>During Father Gerard's time, when Father Elias Mchonde and a first-grade teacher moved to Kasita to establish the seminary, there was no building worthy of being called a school. They found a house known as the 'Kuesterhaus,' which belonged to a German settler named Kuester. In this house, Father Gerard had one room for an office, another for sleeping, and a third room served as a chapel.</p>
        <p>Around sixty students were housed in the settler's warehouse, which stood where the Kasita Church was later built.</p>
        <p>Brother Benno attempted to convert this warehouse into a habitable house. After renovations, it included a laundry area, a kitchen, a storeroom, two dormitory rooms, and a dining hall.</p>
        <p>Classrooms were located on the first floor of the Kuester house. At that time, plans were being made to build the front section of the seminary, and a foundation stone was laid. It was very difficult to find a brother to supervise the construction because the Kwiro school was also being built simultaneously. This challenge is clearly reflected in the letters Father Gerard wrote to Archbishop Edgar Maranta. Eventually, Brother Werner was chosen to oversee the construction, but progress was very slow until Brother Benno took over leadership.</p>
